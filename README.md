# HomeLoans NextJS App

In this project, I have created a home Loan application which provides all the necessary information about a loan .

#### Tech Stack :

NextJS

### Output:

Live Demo: https://4phdt6.sse.codesandbox.io/

### HomeLoans App:

#### Flow of the application:

1. Firstly, I have created a proxy server i.e.,
   https://mailalerts.sabiyatabassum.repl.co/
   because this project involves a real-world API.

2. To hide the api keys, and handle data fetching, creating a proxy server is what I thought is better.

3. Also enabled to cors, to fetch data from backend to my frontend application.

4. In homepage, a list of data is shown having some relative and absolute URLs.

5. Upon clicking on "More Information", the user is routed to a page where all the information of that particular loan is displayed. Here I have used useRouter from next/router to route the user.

6. Upon clicking on "Go to Site" button, the user is redirected to the original loan site.

##### **My Key Takeaways:**

1. This exercise made me to brush up my concepts of NextJS, ReactJS, and basic data fetching from API concepts.
2. Had a fun while making this project.
